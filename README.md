# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for a project predicting Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques.
# Project Overview
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict Parkinson's disease using various features, such as:

# Voice features: 
Jitter, shimmer, and other voice measurements related to speech abnormalities.
# Clinical information: 
Age, gender, medical history, and motor assessments like UPDRS scores.
# Other modalities: 
Sensor data, imaging data (if available), etc.
By developing this model, we hope to contribute to early diagnosis and improved treatment outcomes for Parkinson'sÂ patients.
